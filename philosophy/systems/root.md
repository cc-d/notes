The following concepts I considered today and found interesting:

    Info Root:
        The tree root of information from which information originates before being manifest as systems and their contexts.

    Hard "Problem" of Conciousness:
        Today I considered that my subjective conciousness is not necessarily anything other than the summation of interractions between myself and others, and the possibility of this being consistently replacable and objectively quantifiable.
