Aluminmum has what seems to be ~90%+ reflectivity across the visible spectrum broadly.

A reaction with sulphuric acid, allegedly around 90c and controlled, seems to be effective at temporarily increasing my perceived reflectivity of aluminimum by presumably smoothing out the surface of the metal plus perhaps the oxidation layer as well, although this quickly re-appears.
